Types of maintenance in practice are as shown in the flow chart above:</p>
              <p>Although there are various types of maintenance procedures but the most common and used all over the automobile companies are preventive maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Preventive maintenance<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Preventive maintenance are predetermined works performed at schedule with the aim of preventing the wear and tear or sudden failure of equipment components. Preventive maintenance helps to:<br><br>
                Protect and prolongs life of vehicle and its parts.<br>Improves reliability<br>Decrease cost of replacement.<br><br>Preventive maintenance is therefore a very important breakdown prevention activity.<br>

                <b>2. Repair</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Repair involves fixing any sort of mechanical or electrical device, after vehicle become out of order or broken (known as repair, unscheduled or casualty maintenance.) it may be defined as “All actions which have the objective of retaining an parts function in to a state in which it can performs its required function. The action includes the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative, managerial and supervision activities. Vehicle repair is concerned with<br />
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Diagnosis of the problem,<br />
<br />
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Finding the root cause of the problem,<br />
<br />
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Disassembling the defective parts,<br />
<br />
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Repair/replace the parts,<br />
<br />
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Assembling the parts.<br />
<br />
Repair is a six steps job. No repair job requires more than six steps. These are:<br />
<br />
<b>⦁Measuring</b>: Repair starts the from measurement. These could be linear or angular. One often starts the vehicle repair from measuring the level of engine oil in the crankcase with a dipstick. Some measurements are done by special instrument in the workshop. One uses diagnosis tools to scan the limiting values of sensor and actuators and also to measure battery voltage, charging voltage etc. (Garuda and Python are some examples of diagnosis tools for vehicles)<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>⦁Disassembling</b>: The measured data from vehicle are compared with the vehicle manufacture’s specifications. An “out of specification” condition means problem. In<br />
16 these cases, one may have to disassemble the component to fix the problem. This is<br />
done step by step.<br />
<br />
<b>⦁Machining</b>: The damaged parts may have wear and tear. Some problem may be irregularities. These requires special machine that can fix the job. These include grinding, drilling, turning, facing, pressing, welding etc.<br />
<br />
<b>⦁Installing new or serviced parts</b>: In case of the parts that are worn beyond their function, the parts need to be replaced. New/rebuilt parts are required to be installed.<br />
<br />
<b>⦁Reassembling</b>: After repair, the removed parts are either reinstalled or replaced. This is reassembling. One put the parts back together to make the complete assembly.<br />
<br />
<b>⦁Adjusting</b>: As the vehicle runs, its is certain that parts wear. They may require adjustments periodically. Adjustments also are often needed after service work. For example after replacing drum-brake shoes, adjust the clearance between the lining and the drums.<br />

<b>Failure analysis</b></div>
<div>
<b><br /></b></div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure analysis concentrates more on unexpected failure of machine and components, where defect analysis is more general term and includes different types of defect and faults.</div>
<div>
Four main approaches for failure analysis:-</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Define the problem this may also include finding the function of defective unit.</div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Eliminate the function if possible, what can be done to eliminate the function.</div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Develop alternative means for performing the function.</div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Improve the present means of achieving function.</div>
</div>
<div>
<b><br /></b></div>
<div>
<div>
<b>Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
FTA is the most widely used tool for failure analysis of a vehicle, it is used into the critical aspects of the feasible and selected system design concepts and technologies and manufacturing application with a view to reduce anticipated failure and faults&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Steps to conduct FTA</div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Identify top level events&nbsp;</div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Develop the fault tree&nbsp;</div>
<div>
⦁<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Analysis the fault tree :- Both quantitatively and qualitatively&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
After carrying out the failure analysis of the vehicle and finding out the problems repair work is done. Failure analysis is only performed if there is a certain problem in the vehicle's component. Maintenance requires no failure analysis because this type of job is performed much before the failure of the component.Every automobile company provides a certain standard time and kilometer in reading for a routine checkup of the vehicle known as servicing. For example a Mahindra Maximo plus is provided with a standard time of 2 months from sale or 5000 kilometer for its first servicing to be performed. These servicing gives an advantage of vehicle's long life span, better quality rides and many more functions.</div>
<div>
For the repair function of a vehicle, failure analysis is conducted to notify and verify the problem due to which the component failed. After the analysis certain action is taken for the repair or replacement of the component as per the required need.</div>
<div>
These two are the types of maintenance procedure every automobile company provides the customers with. Automobile workshops conduct these types of maintenance procedure on command of the company itself.&nbsp;</div>
