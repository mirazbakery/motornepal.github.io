            <tr><td><h1>Diffrential</h1><img src="../img/mechanical/crown.jpg" class="car" alt="Image"><br><div id="para"><p> Differential is a gear train that is also a part of power transmission. differential is used to convert the rotational motion of a shaft to the perpendicular shaft located to the main shaft, however this is not the main function of the differential.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit;">In&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">automobiles</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;and other wheeled vehicles, the differential allows the outer&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">drive wheel</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;to rotate faster than the inner drive wheel during a turn. During the turning of a vehicle the outer wheel has to travel a farther distance than the inner wheel, in this condition if the speed of both the wheel are same the turning becomes impossible. So, </span>in order<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;to make the turn possible </span>differential<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;reduces the speed of the inner wheel than that of the outer wheel keeping the speed ratio constant. Different components of a differential gear train are:</p><p><span>1. Pinion gear</span><br />
<span>2. Ring or Crown gear</span><br />
<span>3. Side gears</span><br />
<span>4. Left and Right axle shaft</span><br />
<span>5. Spider gears</span><br />
</p><br><br><p><img src="../img/mechanical/ringgear.jpg" class="car" alt="Image" style="float: right;"><span ><b>1. Pinion gear</b></span></span><br />
<span><b style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The gear that drives the ring gear is known as the pinion. Pinion gear is </span>attached<span>&nbsp;to the shaft that is set in motion by the </span>propeller<span>&nbsp;shaft.</span></span><br />
<span><span><span ><b><br /></b></span></span>
<span><b >2. Crown gear</b></span></span><br />
<span><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Crown gear is the main gear of the differential. This gear transfers the rotary motion into perpendicular axles.</span><br />
<span><span></span><br /></span>
<span ><span></span>
<span ><b>3. Side gears</b></span></span><br />
<span><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Side gears are the gears that are connected to the left and right axle shaft.</span><br />
<span><b></b><br /></span>
<span><b></b>
<b>4. Spider gears</b></span><br />
<span ><span ><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>A</span><span>t the </span>center</span><span>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;</span><span>differential</span><span>, there is a rotating&nbsp;</span><span>carrier</span><span >&nbsp;on the same axis as the two shafts known as spider gears. Torque from a prime mover or transmission, such as the drive shaft of a car, rotates this&nbsp;</span><span>carrier.</span></span><br />
</p>
<p>Generally, in today's automobile </span>differential<span>&nbsp;system the gears used are </span>bevel<span>&nbsp;gears. The propeller shaft drives the pinion which in turn drives the ring gear. a rotating </span>carriage<span>&nbsp;is </span>attached<span>&nbsp;to the ring gear which rotates along with the ring gear transferring the rotary motion to the side gears that are </span>attached<span>&nbsp;to the left and </span>right<span>&nbsp;axle. While in a straight line motion the speed ratio of the inner shaft and the outer shaft is same, but while turning of the vehicle the spider gears come into action reducing the inner shaft's speed and increasing the outer shafts speed keeping the speed ratio constant. This mechanism makes the turning of the Vehicle possible.</p><p>The designing of the differential gears is also as same as that of the process discussed in the </span><span>&nbsp;article the only difference is that the calculations of ratios are made for bevel gears instead of the spur or helical gears. The design are made </span>separately<span>&nbsp;in CAD software and </span>assembled<span>&nbsp;then after. The </span>assembled<span>&nbsp;gear train is then meshed to check the motion of one gear due to the motion of driver gear. After the designing process the designs are simulated and results are compared with the experimental </span>data<span>&nbsp;to verify the design.</span></span></span><br />
<span><span><span><span><br /></span></span></span>
<span>The gears are then manufactured using lathe and milling machines preciously according to the calculated values into the required shape and size. The differential housing is made by casting using the molten metal.<img src="../img/mechanical/pinion.jpg" class="car" alt="Image" style="padding: 2%;"></p>
